CSSettlers
==========

CSSettlers of Catan was my final project for my Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly.
 
The project is a calculator for the Settlers of Catan game, which computes your probability for receiving "game resources" based on strategic "settlement" placements.
 
The project features:

1) Advanced CSS to lay out the game board.  (The hexagons are created in CSS.)

2) JQuery to randomize the game board.

3) JQuery to place the settlements on the game board and change states of modules.

4) Placement of settlements on the game board using coordinates.

5) Javascript / JQuery to calculate the nearest hexagon.
